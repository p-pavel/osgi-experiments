# Core spec

## Security

SecurityManager is scheduler for removal, I don't undestand  how this affects OSGi and what
changes are needed to make it work with OSGi.

## Module layer

- Need to learn more about search filters. Probably construct an algebra for filters, resources and namespaces (and capabilities and requirements). (See `org.osgi.framework.namespace` and `org.osgi.framework.wiring` packages.)
